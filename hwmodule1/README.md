for this assignment I added alt attributes for all images to help blind individuals while using web readers.

I changed all text color from white to black in order to help color blind individuals since it's easy for white text to blend in with the background.

i changed the logo color from white to black since it is extremely easy for it to blend in with the blue background.

instead of distinguishing headings by different colors, I added different fonts to heading as well as boldness for color blind individuals.

I also underlined all headings to make them stand out to visually impaired readers.

I increased all text from 16px to 20px which still looks good while it is more accessible to the visually impaired and elderly.

For paragraphs, I added position relative so that the text doesn't overlap with the images when the web is resized.

I moved some of the css rules around so that they're in order.
